      <description>Mathedemo  MathJax.Hub.Config({tex2jax: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;,&#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;,&#39;\\)&#39;]]}});    You might ask why I skip Euler Problem 6. It’s because Euler Problem 6 is so easy that I don’t want to write a blog about its solution. In this post, we will discuss Euler Problem 7.
Euler Problem 7 By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.</description>

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from \(1\) to \(20\)?
This problem might be a bit confusing. “Evenly divisible” actually means divisible. So, how to find out the smallest positive number that is divisible by \(1, 2, .</description>

      <title>Euler Problem 4: Largest palindrome product</title>

      <description>Euler Problem 4 A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
The solution is to search for palindrome number starting from the largest number. We check if the product of two numbers is a palindrome and replace k with it if it’s larger than k.</description>

In this post, I’m going to use it on the Euler Problem 3.
Euler Problem 3 The prime factors of \(13195\) are \(5, 7, 13\) and \(29\).
What is the largest prime factor of the number \(600851475143\)?</description>

\[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\]
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</description>

Project Euler (named after Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler) is a competition with computational problems. Participants solve these problems using computer code, using many different languages.
This blog was inspired by Devil is in the Data and tries to provide detailed solution in both R and Python to a Euler problem per week.</description>
