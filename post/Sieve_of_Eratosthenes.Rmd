We know a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. If Someone asks you, "What are all prime numbers less than 1 million?", how can you answer the question?

There are many algorithms to find all prime numbers up to any given limit. I'm going to cover the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a simple but powerful algorithm, in this article.

## Sieve of Eratosthenes

To find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes' method:

1. Create a list of consecutive integers from $2$ through $n$ $(2, 3, 4, ..., n)$.

2. Initially, let $p = 2$, the smallest prime number.

3. Enumerate the multiples of $p$ by counting to $n$ from $p ^ 2$ in increments of $p$, and mark them in the list (these will be $p ^ 2, p ^ 2 + p, p ^ 2 + 2p, ...$; the $p$ itself should not be marked).

4. Find the first number greater than $p$ in the list that is not marked. Let $p$ now equal this new number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3. If $p ^ 2$ is greater than $n$, stop.

5. When the algorithm terminates, the numbers remaining not marked in the list are all the primes number not greater than $n$.

### Pseudocode

About algorithm can be expressed in pseudocode as below:

```
Input: an integer n > 1

Let A be an array of Boolean value, indexed by integers 2 to n, initially all set to TRUE.

for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., n ^ (1 / 2):
  if A[i] is TRUE:
    for j = i ^ 2, i ^ 2 + i, i ^ 2 + 2i, ..., n:
      A[j] = FALSE

Output: all i such that A[i] is TRUE.
```

Let's see below gif illustrating the process:

### Implement in R

```{r}
all_prime <- function(n) {
  prime <- rep(TRUE, n)  # Intitialize a vector all set to TRUE
  prime[1] <- FALSE  # Remove 1 from output
  
  for (i in 2:sqrt(n)) {
    if (prime[i]) prime[seq(i ^ 2, n, i)] <- FALSE  # Mark FALSE if composite index.
  }
  
  which(prime)  # Return indices of TRUE
}

# Example, find all prime numbers less or equal to 61
all_prime(61)
```

### Implement in Python
```{python}
import math
import numpy as np

def all_prime(n):
    prime = np.array([True] * (n + 1))  # Intitialize a vector all set to TRUE
    prime[0] = prime[1] = False  # Remove 0 and 1 from output

    for i in range(2, math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))):
        if prime[i]:
            prime[range(i ** 2, n, i)] = False  # Mark FALSE if composite index.

    return np.where(prime == 1)  # Return indices of TRUE
```
