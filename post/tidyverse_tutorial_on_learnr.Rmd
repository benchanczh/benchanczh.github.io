In June 2017, I joined a major Canadian bank as a data analyst. I was suprised that most of my colleagues didn't use R or Python for their day-to-day data analysis. I've been convincing my colleagues that R and Python are great tools for data analysis and trying to give an introduction on these two programming languages. 

Last week I saw a post about [**learnr**](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package on RStudio [Developer Blog](https://blog.rstudio.com/) and I believed this package would be a great tool to create an interactive R tutorial for my team. Then in the following weekend, I created a little [R tidyverse tutorial](https://benjaminchanczh.shinyapps.io/R_tidyverse_tutorial/) based on **learnr** and shared it with my teammates on [shinyapp.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/).

## Building interactive tutorials for R

The **learnr** package makes it easy to turn any R Markdown document into an interactive tutorial. My tutorial is actually a R Markdown file including following content:

#### 1. Exercise

Exercises in **learnr** are interactive R code chunks that allow readers to directly execute R code and see it’s results:

![Exercise examples](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/images/exercises.png)
Exercises can include hints or solutions as well as custom checking code to provide feedback on user answers. 

#### 2. Questions

One or more multiple-choice quiz questions can be included within a tutorial to help verify that readers understand the concepts presented. Questions can either have a single or multiple correct answers. You can also add answer-specific correct/incorrect messages.

#### 3. Video

Sometimes you may think it's easier to explain a complex concept by video than words. **learnr** allows you to include video published on either [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) or [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) within a tutorial using the standard markdown image syntax.

#### 4. Publishing

Tutorials can be published all of the same ways that Shiny applications can, including running locally on an end-user’s machine or running on a Shiny Server or hosting service like [shinyapp.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/).
