      <description>Mathedemo  MathJax.Hub.Config({tex2jax: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;,&#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;,&#39;\\)&#39;]]}});    Euler Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
\[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\]
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</description>

      <description>Mathedemo  MathJax.Hub.Config({tex2jax: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;,&#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;,&#39;\\)&#39;]]}});    The Devil is in the Data website presents solutions to Project Euler problems in R. Project Euler (named after Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler) is a competition with computational problems. Participants solve these problems using computer code, using many different languages.
This blog was inspired by Devil is in the Data and tries to provide detailed solution in both R and Python to a Euler problem per week.</description>

      <title>Using learnr to build an interactive R tutorial</title>

      <description>In June 2017, I joined a major Canadian bank as a data analyst. I was suprised that most of my colleagues didn’t use R or Python for their day-to-day data analysis. I’ve been convincing my colleagues that R and Python are great tools for data analysis and trying to give an introduction on these two programming languages.
Last week I saw a post about learnr package on RStudio Developer Blog and I believed this package would be a great tool to create an interactive R tutorial for my team.</description>
