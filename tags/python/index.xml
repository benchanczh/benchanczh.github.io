      <title>Euler Problem 4: Largest palindrome product</title>

      <description>Euler Problem 4 A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
The solution is to search for palindrome number starting from the largest number. Check if the product of two numbers is palindrome. We break the loop when the first palindrome is found.</description>

In this post, I’m going to use it on the Euler Problem 3.
Euler Problem 3 The prime factors of \(13195\) are \(5, 7, 13\) and \(29\). What is the largest prime factor of the number \(600851475143\)?</description>

If Someone asks you, “What are all prime numbers less than 1 million?”, how can you answer the question?
There are many algorithms to find all prime numbers up to any given limit. I’m going to cover the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a simple but powerful algorithm, in this article.</description>

\[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\]
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</description>

Project Euler (named after Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler) is a competition with computational problems. Participants solve these problems using computer code, using many different languages.
This blog was inspired by Devil is in the Data and tries to provide detailed solution in both R and Python to a Euler problem per week.</description>
